    <h1>Acta-praeterita</h1>
    <p>
        <strong>My journal for sharing the theories and thoughts of Ruski when they arise or from what I remember of my past</strong>
    </p>

    <h1>Contenta Acta Praeteriti</h1>
    <p>
        <strong><em>The journal I am writing will contain the thoughts and theories of Ruski, it also will include how Ruski became and ended, and all the history
        of Ruski and the time spent in and out of the National Socialist movement</em></strong>
    </p>

    <h3>Quare?</h3>
    <p>
        <strong><em>I am writing these as a reflection of myself and the past, and to cope with the unending attacks on my mental being by Ruski, and to give leeway 
        to express his ideas in journaling. I do not know if this will help but it is worth a shot and I'm bored. It also acts as a timeline of the past that I can reflect on sometime in the future and see how much I've overcome.</em></strong>
    </p>

    <h1>Alia Notitia (Discord, etc.)</h1>
    <p>
        <strong><em>For my Discord account, if anyone wants to really contact me (doubt), it will be Vrillpilled88. As for any other information, I do not have any other information to share about this. I may make a separate journal for my everyday life, but that is not very likely.</em></strong>
