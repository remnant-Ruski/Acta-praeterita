# Entry #1 12/2/24

***Iron march, I want to discuss iron march first and formost. The pinnicle of my time, created in 2020, it was a idea first formulated by 14sleepy88, he dissapeared and i took the project into my hands and
re-imagined it into the oringinal iron march website forum but for discord. I wanted to bring back the website but I lacked the skills and knowledge on how. I also wanted a stable membership number before
I started the website, eventually we were getting close to the number. over the 2 year course of Iron march we had reached hundreds of people who had joined the group, the offical count of the members on 
telegram was somewhere around 40 for the original telegram. Eventually my telegram got nuked by 09A satanist and my account banned for illegal activity.
 I had made a fatal error of not making any admins so we had to restart the entire telegram channel. We did do it bette though, we started the main channel as a annoucments channel where people can get
 up to date info on how iron march was running, new propoganda, and new servers after bans. We also formed a chat telegram channel and posted and pinned it in the IM annoucments channel. 

 Idk what much there is to iron much, it was my lifes work, I spent hours and days and years of time into it. It was everything to me, an achievment to me. There wasnt a day where I gave up on iron march,
 I wanted it to run 24/7 and I wanted a devoted base for it. Many wanted me to discontinue it on discord but I refused because I believed in spreading the word and gathering natsocs alike to one community,
 to one banner. And it worked for the most part, id say most of the base of iron march was pure, we made sure to verify each member after the first and last breach. Iron march led its course for the next 3 
 years and had its major struggle in 2023 and late 2022, the dark age of iron march. 

 I still remember the email AQVILA had responded with to my email, that iron march was no longer up and they all had started seperating from the natsoc movment, as to his email, it did feel like a slap to
 the face as he mentioned it may feel. I took what he said about the situation very seriously though, and I wasnt ready to give up on iron march and was vowing to bring it back when I returned to the scene.
  I held onto this belief for the following majority of months till i subsequently left the movement. Well I am exhausted by sleep deprivation so I am going to end this first entry lackluster sadly.***
