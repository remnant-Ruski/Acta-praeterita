    <h2>Entry #1 12/2/24</h2>

        <strong><em>Iron march, I want to discuss iron march first and foremost. The pinnacle of my time, created in 2020, it was an idea first formulated by 14sleepy88. He disappeared and I took the project into my hands and re-imagined it into the original iron march website forum but for Discord. I wanted to bring back the website but I lacked the skills and knowledge on how. I also wanted a stable membership number before I started the website; eventually, we were getting close to the number. Over the 2-year course of Iron march, we had reached hundreds of people who had joined the group, the official count of the members on Telegram was somewhere around 40 for the original Telegram. Eventually, my Telegram got nuked by 09A satanist and my account banned for illegal activity. I had made a fatal error of not making any admins, so we had to restart the entire Telegram channel. We did do it better though; we started the main channel as an announcements channel where people can get up-to-date info on how iron march was running, new propaganda, and new servers after bans. We also formed a chat Telegram channel and posted and pinned it in the IM announcements channel.</em></strong>

        <strong><em>Idk what much there is to iron march, it was my life's work, I spent hours and days and years of time into it. It was everything to me, an achievement to me. There wasn't a day where I gave up on iron march, I wanted it to run 24/7, and I wanted a devoted base for it. Many wanted me to discontinue it on Discord, but I refused because I believed in spreading the word and gathering natsocs alike to one community, to one banner. And it worked for the most part; I'd say most of the base of iron march was pure; we made sure to verify each member after the first and last breach. Iron march led its course for the next 3 years and had its major struggle in 2023 and late 2022, the dark age of iron march.</em></strong>

        <strong><em>I still remember the email AQVILA had responded with to my email, that iron march was no longer up, and they all had started separating from the natsoc movement. As to his email, it did feel like a slap to 
        the face as he mentioned it may feel. I took what he said about the situation very seriously though, and I wasn't ready to give up on iron march and 
        was vowing to bring it back when I returned to the scene. I held onto this belief for the following majority of months till I subsequently left the 
        movement. Well I am exhausted by sleep deprivation so I am going to end this first entry lackluster sadly.</em></strong>
