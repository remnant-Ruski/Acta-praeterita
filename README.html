    <p><strong><em>The journal I am writing will contain the thoughts and theories of Ruski. It also will include how Ruski became and ended, and all the history
    of Ruski and the time spent in and out of the National Socialist movement.</em></strong></p>

    <h2 id="quare-">Quare?</h2>
    <p><strong><em>I am writing these as a reflection of myself and the past, and to cope with the unending attacks on my mental being by Ruski, and to give leeway 
    to express his ideas in journaling. I do not know if this will help, but it is worth a shot and I'm bored. It also acts as a timeline of the past that I can reflect on sometime in the future and see how much I've overcome.</em></strong></p>

As for any other information, I do not have any other information to share about this. I may make a separate journal for my everyday life, but that is not very likely.</em></strong></p>
